// 1. Apply Dependency Injection and Dependency Inversion in JPMC (NYC Schools)code




// 2. Diff b/w Dependency Injection and Inversion
//  - Dependency Injection: There are three methods to do it: Initializer, Functionl parameter, Global Vairbles. It supplies a property of an instance outside of its scope. Dependency Inversion is a principle that supggests high level moduls should not depend on low level modules. They should depend on abstractions like interfaces.

// 3. What is TDD
//  - Testt Driven Development: It's a thinking process driven by unit test cases before developing the actual code.

// 4. pros and cones of TDD
//  - It helps developers better analyze and understand slient requirements. Test coverage underTDD is higher than conventional development
//  - It takes more time and effort to run the test and refactoring if without experiences.
